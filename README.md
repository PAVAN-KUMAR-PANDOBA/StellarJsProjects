# Countdown Timer Project

This project implements a simple countdown timer to calculate the time remaining until a specified future date.

## Overview

The countdown timer is set to count down to the date "1 Jan 2025". It calculates and displays the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds dynamically on an HTML page.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the countdown timer page.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for calculating the countdown and updating the HTML page.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the countdown timer page.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The page will display the remaining time until "1 Jan 2025", updating every second.
